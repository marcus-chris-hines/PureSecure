# Oficial Landing Page – How to Run It

This project is set up so you **don’t have to install PHP or Apache yourself**.  
You just use Docker, run one command, and then edit the HTML/CSS files like normal.

---

## 1. What You Need

1. **Docker** installed on your computer  
   - If you don’t have it: download **Docker Desktop** for your system and install it.
2. That’s it.

## 2. Folder Setup

Your files should look like this:

```text
project-folder/
  docker-compose.yml
  oficial/
    MainPage.html
    home-1.html
    home-2.html
    assets/
    php/
    ... (other template files)
